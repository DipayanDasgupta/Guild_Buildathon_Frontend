## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Smart AI Form Filling Flow:**
  - Users upload a KYC or policy document on the dashboard.
  - The app calls the backend, which uses Gemini AI to extract all relevant data.

- **Fully Functional Client CRM:**
  - The "Clients" section in the sidebar features dropdowns to filter clients by status (`Active`, `Engaged`, `Prospective`).
  - The main clients page is a powerful dashboard with dynamic filtering, searching, and the ability to add new clients via a modal form or delete existing ones.

- **Automatic Reconciliation Dashboard:**
  - A dedicated page for uploading bank and policy PDFs.
  - After the backend's AI engine processes the files, the frontend displays a clear summary of matched transactions and highlights the exceptions that require manual review.

  - A professional, mobile-first design that looks great on all devices.
  - Features a collapsible sidebar for enhanced screen real-estate.
  - Includes a user-friendly light/dark mode theme toggle.
