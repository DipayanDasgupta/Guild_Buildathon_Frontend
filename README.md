This repository contains the frontend application for the "InsureAgent" dashboard, a complete solution for **Problem Statement 2** of The Guild Buildathon. It is a modern, responsive, multi-page Next.js (React) application deployed on Vercel, designed to be the primary interface for insurance micro-entrepreneurs.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Professional UI/UX:** A sleek, multi-page dashboard inspired by the Turtlemint design aesthetic, built with standard CSS for maximum reliability and performance.

- **Interactive Document Upload:**
  - Features a drag-and-drop file zone for uploading policy documents and images.
  - Communicates directly with the live Python/Flask backend to trigger the AI processing pipeline.

  - Presents AI-generated analytics (summary, category, sentiment, action items) in a clean, interactive modal view.
- **Data-Driven Components:** The "Recent Clients" table on the dashboard fetches its data directly from the live `/api/clients` endpoint.
